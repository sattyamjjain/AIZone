### Introduction
Welcome to AIZone, a rich and detailed exploration of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms and their techniques. This project serves as a resource for learners and practitioners alike, offering practical implementations and deep dives into the theory behind some of the most commonly used algorithms in data science.

### Project Structure
#### Overview
AIZone is structured into several modules, each focusing on a different aspect of machine learning. The project contains a series of Jupyter notebooks, each designed to explain and demonstrate a specific machine-learning algorithm or technique. 

#### Modules
- **Classification**: This section includes notebooks on different classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), etc. Each notebook provides practical examples, algorithm insights, and coding exercises.
   - *Key Notebooks*: DecisionTrees.ipynb, KNearestNeighbors.ipynb, etc.
- **Clustering**: Focused on clustering techniques, particularly K-means clustering, this module explores unsupervised learning algorithms used for data grouping.
   - *Key Notebook*: KMeansClustering.ipynb
- **LinearRegression**: Contains notebooks that explain both simple and multiple linear regression models, their applications, and statistical insights.
   - *Key Notebooks*: SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb, MulitpleLinearRegression.ipynb
- **LogisticRegression**: This module includes logistic regression and extensions like multi-class classification, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs).
   - *Key Notebooks*: LogisticRegression.ipynb, MultiClassClassification.ipynb, SupportVectorMachine.ipynb
- **NeuralNetwork**: Provides a deep dive into artificial neural networks, their architecture, and functioning with hands-on examples.
   - *Key Notebook*: ArtificialNeuralNetwork.ipynb
